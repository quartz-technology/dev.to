# Setup HTTPS with NGINX and Certbot

During the deployment of a new application, it is common to make the application
accessible through a [domain name](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/).

This is a simple step, really satisfying, but I used to struggle a bit when I started to
do it for my first client.

Project architecture are usually the same, you got a proxy like NGINX that will
take care of the redirection to your application(s).
As security measure you setup a firewall and open port `80` and `443` to allow traffic on HTTP and HTTPS.

![basic application deployment on a VPS using NGINX as proxy exposing port 80 and 443](./nginx-simple-app-architecture.png)

And then it comes to set up HTTPS, and questions like "should I expose my application before enabling HTTPS?", 
"how do I just do that?", "wait, where do I store those configuration files?".

This article targets beginners who want a simple and fast way to set HTTPS on any application
deployed on a VPS.

## Why set up HTTPS?

A bit of theory before starting, why is it important to set up HTTPS on your application?

Basically, HTTPS adds a security layer around HTTP protocol thanks to TLS encryption.
When a request is sent with HTTPS, it hides the content of the request, so it cannot be
intercepted and used by an attacker.

Here is a [great article from CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/why-use-https/) for the most curious.

## Set up VPS environment

For this article, I'll use a basic VPS with Ubuntu as operating system and the domain name
`example.vasek.technology`.

To begin, we need to install [Nginx](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/why-use-https/)
and [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org).

Nginx is a powerful tool for web serving. We will use it to catch requests sent to
the domain name and redirect them to the application.
Certbot is a simple CLI to set HTTPS on a server.

You do not need to set up your application to enable HTTPS, you can do that later.

Let's install Nginx.

```shell
# Update apt dependencies
sudo apt update

# Install Nginx
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

This will automatically set up Nginx as a service in your VPS so it will be automatically restart
if you shut down your VPS and start it later.

You can verify that Nginx is correctly configured with `sudo systemctl status nginx`.

![sudo systemctl status nginx result showing running status](./system-nginx-status.png)

You should also see a new folder in `etc/nginx` containing a lot of files and folders.
Let's not pay attention to them for now.

```shell
conf.d          koi-utf     modules-available  proxy_params     sites-enabled  win-utf
fastcgi.conf    koi-win     modules-enabled    scgi_params      snippets
fastcgi_params  mime.types  nginx.conf         sites-available  uwsgi_params
```

If you go to your IP address on your web browser, you should also see the default
Nginx welcome page.

![nginx welcome page](./nginx-welcome-page.png)

Let's now install Certbot, to do so we will need Python.

```shell
# Install python3
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv libaugeas0

# Set up a virtual environment to not conflict with our local one
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/certbot/

# Install pip in this environment
sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install --upgrade pip

# Install Certbot with nginx plugin
sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install certbot certbot-nginx

# Create a symbolic link to access use certbot from anywhere
sudo ln -s /opt/certbot/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot

# Verify certbot is installed
certbot --version
# certbot 2.3.0
```

## Link domain name to VPS IP

It is time to link your domain name to the VPS IP, so you can access the page from
it.

I personally use Google Domain but any domain name manager works.
Let's create a [A record](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record/) that points to your VPS IP.

![domain name A record creation example on Google Domain](./domain-record.png)

After few minutes, you should be able to access your website on this domain name.

![nginx welcome page accessed through domain name](./nginx-welcome-page-http.png)

But as you see, it is still written as not secure. Let's fix that!

## Set up basic Nginx configuration

Create a new file `nginx.conf` anywhere in your VPS and add the most basic
configuration that will simply serve the welcome page.
We will set up a symbolic link later to let Nginx use it.

```nginx
server {
	# Listen on HTTP port (80)
	listen 80;

	# Serve Nginx welcome page
	root /var/www/html;

	# Set domain name to serve.
	server_name example.vasek.technlogy www.example.vasek.technology;
}
```

Now we need two last thing.

First, the default index.html page in `/var/www/html` may not be named properly.
By default, Nginx will look for `index.html`.

In my case, it is always named `index.nginx-debian.html`, let's rename it
to `index.html`

```shell
# Check for files in /var/www/html
ls /var/www/html
# index.nginx-debian.html

# Rename it to index.html
mv /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html /var/www/html/index.html
```

Secondly, Nginx will process every config files located in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.
I usually prefer to create a symbolic link to that location, so I can maintain it
from my git repository. So others can review it and if it is simpler if I want to change
my VPS.

```shell
# Create a symbolic link. Make sure to use an absolute path to your nginx config
# file using $PWD variable
ln -s "$PWD/nginx.conf" /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nginx.conf 

# Show the file to verify the symbolic link has been correctly done.
cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nginx.conf 
server {
	# Listen on HTTP port (80)
	listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
	
	# Serve Nginx welcome page
	root /var/www/html;

	# Set domain name to serve.
	server_name example.vasek.technology www.example.vasek.technology;
}
```

You can also remove the default configure

```shell
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Let's verify that our config is correct.

```shell
nginx -t
# nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
# nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

It is normal if you do not see your file in the log, the main config is in
`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and includes any files in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`

Now we can reload nginx to apply new configuration.

```shell
nginx -s reload
```

Let's verify if the nginx still serve the welcome page on our domain name

![nginx welcome page accessed through domain name](./nginx-welcome-page-http.png)

## Use Certbot to enable HTTPS

It is time set up HTTPS on our domain name. Let's run Certbot.

```shell
# Generate SSL certificate using certbot.
certbot --nginx -d example.vasek.technology --email tom@quartz.technology
```

Note that the `--email` is an important option, you should provide a valid 
address email that will stay in time. This email is used as proof of ownership
and is used by site like [Whois](https://whois.domaintools.com) to record all
domain names and their owner.

If you take a look at your `nginx.conf`, you will see a lot of changes.

```nginx
server {	
	# Serve Nginx welcome page
	root /var/www/html;

	# Set domain name to serve.
	server_name example.vasek.technology www.example.vasek.technology;

    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.vasek.technology-0001/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.vasek.technology-0001/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    if ($host = example.vasek.technology) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


	listen 80;
	listen [::]:80;
	server_name example.vasek.technology www.example.vasek.technology;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
```

The file has been updated by Certbot to serve HTTPS on your dns and also redirect
HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
It may be a bit messy so clean extra spaces and reorder tabs if necessary.

You can go back on your domain name and see that HTTPS is now enable.


![nginx welcome page accessed through domain name with HTTPS](./nginx-welcome-page-https.png)

Congratulation! You can now update your configuration to serve your application
after deploying it on your VPS.

For example

```nginx
	# Serve Nginx welcome page
	# Replaced by location
	# root /var/www/html;
	
	
	# Redirect request to application listening on
	# port 3000 in the VPS.
	location / {
	    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
	}
```

I hope this article was useful to you! I remember my first time struggling to add HTTPS on
my first application with 10 different tabs opened about Nginx and its obscure configuration.
